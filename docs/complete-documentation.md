:::

Moony‚Äôs total supply is permanently capped at 21 million units. This constraint is hardcoded at the protocol level and cannot be increased, adjusted, or bypassed. There are no emission schedules, no inflation mechanics, no levers to expand supply.

Scarcity is the root of monetary integrity. Fixed supply creates a predictable economic substrate, allowing participants to coordinate, price, and transact with confidence over time. It transforms Moony from a token into a trustless accounting system, a neutral measure of value that cannot be manipulated by design.

Where legacy systems rely on policy decisions to manage monetary expansion, Moony requires none. Its scarcity is not enforced by governance but by architecture. That difference is essential: it eliminates uncertainty, removes human discretion, and aligns long-term value with immutable code, not mutable promises.

Every unit of Moony is fully fungible and divisible to 10 decimal places. Whether a user transacts with ‚çú100 or ‚çú0.01, each unit behaves identically and holds the same value within the system. No history, no identity, no hierarchy, just uniform economic expression.

Fungibility is critical to monetary neutrality. It ensures that Moony can serve as a general-purpose medium of exchange across any context, whether peer-to-peer payments, protocol integrations, commerce, or digital ecosystems. In Moony‚Äôs design, no unit is special, and no actor holds privileged value.

This uniformity is a structural safeguard against fragmentation, discrimination, and value distortion. It aligns with the protocol‚Äôs broader ethos of fairness: just as Moony‚Äôs distribution model avoids insider advantages, its monetary logic avoids coin-level bias. The network treats all units, and all participants, the same.































### Reserve Contract

Moony‚Äôs tokenomics architecture is grounded in foundational monetary principles and implemented through a transparent, immutable protocol design. It establishes a system where value is issued without discretion, access is open to all, and incentives align with the long-term integrity of the asset.

The protocol‚Äôs design rests on four core monetary principles: fixed supply, fungibility, cryptographic scarcity, and a zero allocation model. These properties form the monetary substrate, defining how value enters circulation, how it behaves, and how trust is established without intermediaries.

Built on top of this base layer are the protocol‚Äôs architectural mechanisms: an immutable reserve contract, a transparent bonding curve, and a proof-of-liquidity model that links capital inflows to token distribution. Together, these interlocking components ensure fairness, verifiability, and composability, creating a system that is resilient, accessible, and aligned with the ethos of digital public goods.

Moony‚Äôs architecture is built upon a foundational monetary layer, one that draws directly from the enduring tenets of sound money: scarcity, fungibility, and fairness of distribution. These are practical design constraints that enable open participation, rule-based coordination, and resistance to manipulation. Each is embedded directly into the protocol, forming a base monetary structure that requires no trust, no permission, and no discretion.

In a digital age defined by monetary experimentation, governance toggles, and engineered incentives, Moony reaffirms something simpler: a fixed, transparent, and neutral monetary core that anyone can access and no one can control. What follows are the three monetary principles that anchor this foundation.

:::

Moony‚Äôs economic architecture is governed entirely by code. Its protocol operates without intermediaries, central administrators, or external governance. Distribution, pricing, and liquidity are enforced by an immutable onchain contract that executes transparently and without discretion.

At the core of this system is the Reserve Contract, a smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain that deterministically issues Moony in response to user deposits. Every unit of Moony that enters circulation is acquired directly through the Reserve, using capital supplied by users. This structure eliminates discretionary allocation and ensures fair access. There are no insiders, no fundraising rounds, no privileged entries. The protocol treats all participants equally, and all interactions occur transparently onchain.

Monetary soundness is not defined by supply alone, it is also defined by how that supply is introduced. Moony launched with no pre-mines, no team reserves, no investor discounts, and no airdrops. No supply was withheld, and no insiders received privileged access.

Every unit of Moony must be acquired through transparent, permissionless interaction with the protocol. This is not an ideological gesture; it is a structural design choice that eliminates hierarchy, removes reliance on trust, and ensures that the playing field is level from the outset.

In an ecosystem often defined by uneven allocations, unlock schedules, and backroom deals, Moony takes the opposite path: full neutrality at launch, enforced by immutable code. Its issuance is not managed, it is available. Not distributed, but discoverable. Everyone enters on the same terms, and the protocol enforces the rules for all.


#### How It Works

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

When a user deposits USDC (a dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle), the Reserve contract calculates a price using a deterministic bonding curve. It mints the corresponding amount of Moony and sends it to the user, holding the USDC onchain as protocol liquidity. This ensures that Moony's circulating supply is always backed by verifiable onchain capital. 

To sell Moony, users send tokens back to the Reserve contract. The contract returns USDC to the user at the bonding curve's current redemption rate. This two-way interaction allows users to enter and exit the system at transparent, algorithmically defined prices without requiring any centralized market makers or discretionary approvals.

The contract is immutable. There are no upgrade keys or administrative controls. Its logic cannot be altered or overwritten post-deployment. This immutability guarantees that the rules of the system are fixed from the outset, creating a predictable foundation for value and trust.


#### Design Principles

- **Immutable:** The Reserve Contract cannot be altered once deployed. There are no admin keys, upgrade paths, or special permissions. The issuance, pricing, and redemption logic is permanently encoded at the smart contract level, ensuring no future changes or governance actions can override it.

- **Permissionless:** Anyone can interact with the Reserve Contract directly from their own wallet. No intermediaries, KYC, whitelists, or gatekeepers are required. The system is open to individuals, developers, protocols, and platforms alike.

- **Non-custodial:** The Reserve Contract never takes custody of user assets in the traditional sense. All interactions are contract-to-wallet: users deposit USDC directly and receive Moony, or return Moony to receive USDC. No third party holds or manages user funds.

- **Transparent:** All supply, liquidity, pricing, and contract interactions are recorded on the Solana blockchain. This makes the entire system publicly auditable and provable in real time.

#### Flipcash Infrastructure

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Moony launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash, Inc., an independent third-party company. Flipcash has no control over Moony's issuance, supply, or pricing; those parameters are governed entirely by the Reserve Contract.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public front end for interacting with the Reserve. Through its mobile app, users can seamlessly convert between USDC and Moony, and send peer-to-peer payments using Moony as digital cash.

##### Flipcash Enables Users To:

- **Access Reserve:** Buy and sell Moony through an intuitive mobile interface.
- **Send Payments:** Transact freely with Moony across devices, using digital cash or links.

Moony is not limited to any platform. The Reserve Contract is open to all developers and integrators, and Moony can be used across any app, wallet, or protocol that supports Solana. This ensures maximum composability, interoperability, and future-proof adoption.

### Proof of Liquidity

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Moony uses a distribution mechanism called Proof of Liquidity (PoL), implemented entirely through its immutable on-chain reserve contract. Under this model, new tokens enter circulation exclusively in exchange for verifiable on‚Äëchain capital, ensuring issuance is transparent, market‚Äëdriven, and free from discretionary control.

Each Moony token is issued in exchange for USDC, a widely used, dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group, Inc. This pairing provides familiar dollar‚Äëbased valuation and lowers the entry barrier for new participants.

The Moony reserve contract holds all USDC deposits as onchain liquidity, enabling redemptions and anchoring supply in verifiable value. Token pricing is determined by a bonding curve, a deterministic function that increases cost as more tokens are minted, ensuring that issuance is transparent, demand-driven, and algorithmically defined.

#### Key Properties

- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint Moony by interacting directly with the reserve contract, with no approvals or intermediaries required.
- **Proof of Liquidity:** Capital used to mint Moony remains in the reserve, supporting redemptions and ensuring liquidity to support the market as it grows.
- **Bonding Curve:** Token pricing is governed by a deterministic bonding curve, meaning the price increases as more tokens are minted. This ensures that supply issuance is aligned with real demand.

#### Capital-Based Mining

Moony's Proof of Liquidity (PoL) mechanism offers a capital‚Äëdriven alternative to traditional Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëWork (PoW) distribution models. Instead of consuming vast amounts of energy through specialized hardware to compete for block rewards, participants mint Moony by depositing USDC directly into the on‚Äëchain Reserve Contract. This shifts issuance from energy‚Äëintensive computation to verifiable, capital‚Äëbased participation.

This model redefines mining as a constructive economic activity rather than an extractive one. Each deposit not only mints new Moony but also strengthens the network by adding permanent, redeemable on‚Äëchain liquidity. Where traditional mining externalizes environmental costs, PoL compounds value inside the ecosystem, aligning participant incentives with collective benefit.

By combining PoL with Solana's carbon‚Äëefficient infrastructure, Moony achieves a distribution model that is both sustainable and economically reinforcing. Every minted token leaves lasting value in the network, deepens market liquidity, and ensures that growth reflects genuine demand, creating a self‚Äësustaining framework for the issuance of scarce digital assets.

This process is:

- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate as demand arises, without permission or centralized control.
- **Economically Constructive**: All capital remains in the Reserve Contract, forming the liquidity backbone of Moony's economy.
- **Energy Efficient**: By replacing energy-intensive computation with on-chain capital deposits, PoL reduces environmental impact and complements Solana's low-carbon infrastructure.

#### Fee Model

Acquiring Moony directly from the Reserve Contract carries no fee, enabling cost‚Äëefficient entry into the ecosystem. Redemptions, selling Moony back to the Reserve Contract for USDC, incur a 1% fee.

This mechanism serves two purposes:

- **Security**: The fee mitigates the risk of sandwich attacks, a form of front‚Äërunning in which automated bots attempt to profit from predictable price movements by inserting transactions around a user's trade.
- **Revenue**: Fee proceeds are directed to Flipcash Inc., the developer of the Reserve Contract's architecture. While Moony was launched as an independent protocol, it leverages this infrastructure to facilitate permissionless access.

The sell‚Äëside fee applies only to redemptions executed directly against the Reserve Contract. Peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer transfers and secondary market transactions, whether on centralized or decentralized exchanges, are not subject to this fee.



### Bonding Curve

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Moony's price discovery is governed by an on‚Äëchain bonding curve, a deterministic mathematical function encoded within the Reserve Contract. The curve dynamically adjusts the token's price based on the proportion of the total fixed supply currently in circulation.

This mechanism applies symmetrically to both minting and redemption. When new Moony is issued, the curve calculates the cost in USDC according to current circulating supply; when Moony is redeemed, it determines the USDC return using the same logic. As circulating supply increases, the curve raises the price in a non‚Äëlinear fashion. This exponential structure is intentional: it rewards early participation with lower entry costs, requires later participants to contribute proportionally more liquidity, and naturally reinforces Moony's scarcity over time.

#### Core Principles

- **Price Increases with Demand:** As users mint Moony from the Reserve Contract, the circulating supply increases and the bonding curve adjusts the price upward with each transaction.

- **Price Also Governs Redemption:** When users redeem Moony for USDC through the Reserve, the curve calculates the return value based on the current supply position.

- **Predictable and Transparent:** Pricing is fully deterministic, enforced by on‚Äëchain logic, and free from discretionary control.

- **Aligned Incentives:** Early adopters gain an advantage, while later participants strengthen network liquidity through higher‚Äëpriced entries.

#### Model Parameters

The bonding curve follows a non‚Äëlinear exponential function:

```math
Price = base\_price √ó (1 + rate)^{supply\_percent - 1}
```

##### Key Variables

*The price for the first 1% of supply*

```math
base\_price = $0.01 \text{ USDC}
```

*Price increase for each additional 1% of total supply issued*

```math
rate = 0.2045 \text{ (20.45%)}
```

*Percentage of the total fixed supply currently in circulation*

```math
supply\_percent = \frac{\text{Current Circulating Supply}}{21,000,000} √ó 100
```

##### Price Progression Chart

```
Supply %    Price per Token    Total Cost for 1%
1%         $0.01             $2,100

(insert infographics in this space)
```

**Note**: This chart shows the exponential growth using the precise 20.45% rate. The final tokens approach $1,000,000 each as the curve becomes nearly vertical at 100% supply.

This model guarantees deterministic, transparent price progression. The first 1% of Moony supply is priced at $0.01 per token, while the final tokens cost $1,000,000 each. The non‚Äëlinear curve is central to Moony's economic design: early activity is rewarded with lower acquisition costs, while later entrants add more capital to the Reserve, deepening liquidity and ensuring the system scales in proportion to demand.

#### Market Dynamics

While the Reserve Contract governs Moony's primary issuance and redemption pricing, price discovery may also occur on secondary markets, including centralized exchanges or peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer platforms. These market prices may temporarily diverge from the bonding curve price. However, the Reserve's transparent pricing mechanism creates an arbitrage anchor. If Moony trades above the Reserve price, users can mint from the Reserve at a lower cost. If Moony trades below the Reserve price, arbitrageurs can buy on the market and redeem to the Reserve. This dynamic keeps market prices tethered to the curve, reinforcing liquidity and price stability across platforms.

### P2P Payments

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments represent Moony's most direct utility: enabling value transfer between individuals without intermediaries. By combining a credibly fixed supply with on-chain settlement, Moony delivers global digital cash with finality, transparency, and negligible fees.

#### Why It Matters

Legacy payment systems rely on layered intermediaries such as banks, processors, or card networks, each introducing cost, latency, and potential for control or exclusion. Transactions can be delayed, reversed, or denied entirely, with entire regions excluded from participation.

Moony's P2P model is different:

- **Direct settlement:** Transfers occur directly on-chain between sender and recipient, with no custodial middleman.
- **Trust minimization:** Settlement rules are enforced by code, not dependent on counterparties.
- **Censorship resistance:** Valid transactions are processed so long as participants can access the network.
- **Global accessibility:** Anyone with internet access and a compatible wallet can participate.

#### Global Scalability

To make P2P viable at scale, both cost and throughput must support everyday usage. These characteristics make Moony suitable for daily transactions, not just high-value transfers. Moony launches on Solana to meet these requirements:

- **Low Fees:** Typical transfers cost fractions of a cent, with fees known at submission.
- **Throughput & latency:** Solana's high-performance network supports rapid confirmations without congestion.
- **Composability:** The same infrastructure powering P2P also enables micropayments, streaming, and automated settlement.

Together, these properties make Moony credible for daily payments, not just occasional high‚Äëvalue transactions.

#### Financial Inclusion

Billions of people remain underserved, or entirely excluded, by traditional payment systems. In many regions, the absence of reliable banking infrastructure leaves individuals unable to store value securely, send money across borders, or participate in even the most basic forms of commerce. 

Where banking does exist, high fees, slow settlement times, and rigid requirements place meaningful participation out of reach for many. Cross‚Äëborder remittances can take days to arrive, cost double‚Äëdigit percentages in fees, and are often impractical for small amounts, limiting economic mobility and reinforcing systemic barriers.

Moony addresses these challenges:

- **Open access:** Anyone with a smartphone can receive Moony without bank accounts or gatekeepers.
- **Remittance:** Affordable, near-instant settlement for cross-border payments.
- **Commerce:** Merchants and creators can accept payments without card fees or chargebacks.
- **Availability:** Operates 24/7, unaffected by weekends or holidays, like traditional systems.

Moony's peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer architecture offers a different path: one that bypasses the bottlenecks of legacy finance and extends open participation to anyone with a mobile device. By removing intermediaries and leveraging low‚Äëcost, high‚Äëspeed blockchain settlement, Moony makes direct digital transactions viable at a scale and inclusivity level traditional rails cannot match.

#### Interoperable Access

Moony is issued as an SPL token on the Solana blockchain, ensuring that it is fully interoperable and not bound to any single interface or platform. From the moment it is minted, Moony is part of a broader composable ecosystem where users and developers can freely move, store, and integrate the asset without permission. This open design not only reinforces Moony's role as decentralized digital cash but also guarantees that its utility can expand organically across a variety of independent applications.

Several key properties enable this interoperability:

- **Wallet compatibility:** Any Solana‚Äëcompatible wallet that supports SPL tokens can hold and transfer Moony. Users are free to manage their balances in the interface of their choice, rather than being locked into a single custodial or proprietary app.
- **Composability:** Moony can be added to payment apps, point‚Äëof‚Äësale systems, bots, and custodial or non‚Äëcustodial services with minimal friction. Developers can plug into Moony the same way they support any other SPL token, allowing it to circulate naturally through the ecosystem.

Because Moony is permissionless and composable by design, its peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer utility is not constrained to a single application. The token can flow seamlessly between wallets, payment interfaces, and future onchain services, creating a foundation for global accessibility and financial inclusion as the network of integrations grows.

#### Flipcash Infrastructure

Moony and it's reserve contract were launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash Inc., an independent third-party company. Flipcash does not maintain control over Moony or its reserve contract, nor can it alter the protocol's issuance, pricing, or supply mechanisms. These parameters are defined entirely by Moony's immutable smart contract, ensuring the protocol remains open and permissionless from the start.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public interface for interacting directly with the Moony Reserve Contract. Through its mobile app, users can seamlessly buy Moony or sell Moony for USDC. Flipcash also offers an industry-leading, trustless peer-to-peer payments experience, giving users a seamless way to transact with Moony.

##### Flipcash Enables Users To:

- **Interact With Reserve:** Seamlessly convert between Moony and USDC through an intuitive interface.

:::

While Flipcash provides the first front end to access the Moony reserve contract, Moony is not limited to any single platform. Designed as a digital public good, Moony can be integrated into any third party platform, protocol,wallet, or app, ensuring broad utility, composability, and adoption.

### Micropayments

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Micropayments, transactions valued in cents or fractions of a cent, have historically been impractical under legacy financial rails. Percentage‚Äëbased fees, multi‚Äëday settlement cycles, and reliance on centralized intermediaries make low‚Äëvalue transfers uneconomical, cutting off entire categories of digital commerce. 

These limitations have forced creators, developers, and small businesses into centralized platforms that aggregate payments, take substantial fees, and control audience relationships. Moony removes these barriers. Built for high‚Äëvolume, low‚Äëvalue transactions, it combines extreme divisibility with near‚Äëzero fees to make micropayments viable at a global scale. By doing so, it unlocks entirely new economic behaviors that were previously impossible or uneconomical.

#### Why It Matters

Micropayments are not simply smaller versions of ordinary transactions, they are a missing building block of the modern internet economy. The inability to move tiny amounts of value efficiently has shaped the digital landscape in ways that limit innovation and inclusion:

- **Centralization**: Without cost‚Äëeffective direct payment rails, creators and small businesses are forced into platforms that bundle transactions, take large fees, and control access to audiences.

- **Subscriptions**: The impracticality of per‚Äëuse billing forces consumers into subscription models, paying for more than they actually use.

- **Bottlenecks**: Entire categories of applications, such as real‚Äëtime metering, per‚Äëunit API calls, or machine‚Äëto‚Äëmachine commerce, remain underdeveloped because payment systems cannot handle the volume or economics they require.

#### Moony's Advantage

Moony's architecture is purpose‚Äëbuilt to make micropayments economically viable at global scale. The token's extreme divisibility allows transactions measured in fractions of a cent, ideal for tipping, micro‚Äërewards, metered services, and other fine‚Äëgrained use cases. 

Every transfer settles on the Solana blockchain with trust‚Äëminimized execution and irreversible finality, eliminating reliance on banks, processors, or escrow services. Solana's high‚Äëthroughput design keeps fees to a fraction of a cent and confirms transactions in seconds, free from banking hours or remittance corridors. Low fees are the foundation that make real‚Äëtime, granular monetization possible, enabling sustainable small‚Äëvalue transfers that expand markets, drive innovation, and open the digital economy to all.

#### Potential Applications

Moony's micropayment capabilities enable a wide range of practical and programmable economic models:

Micropayments with Moony open the door to innovative digital and physical interactions, including:

- **Pay-Per-Use:** Unlock content, articles, videos, or AI tools for pennies without recurring subscriptions.
- **In-App Purchase:** Purchase digital items, upgrades, or event access without credit card integrations.
- **Streaming Payments:** Transfer value continuously in real time for services like media consumption or cloud computing.
- **M2M Commerce:** Automate exchange of bandwidth, energy, or data in precise micro‚Äëincrements.
- **Direct Support:** Send low‚Äëfee micro‚Äëtips to artists, streamers, or writers without intermediary platform fees.

By combining scarce, divisible digital cash with low‚Äëcost, high‚Äëthroughput settlement, Moony turns micropayments from an abstract ideal into a practical, composable building block for a decentralized, internet‚Äënative economy.

### Capital Markets

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents the foundation of internet capital markets, a global financial system built on open, programmable infrastructure. In this environment, lending, borrowing, trading, and yield generation occur directly through smart contracts without the need for banks or traditional intermediaries. 

Rather than trusting institutions, participants rely on transparent, verifiable code. Value moves globally, at all hours, without gatekeepers. This shift is not just technological. Internet capital markets mark a cultural transformation, offering an open alternative to legacy finance, driven by code, capital, and community.

#### Why It Matters

Traditional finance relies on layers of centralized institutions such as banks, clearinghouses, and brokers that enforce access restrictions, add costs, and slow down settlement.

This system creates multiple frictions:

- **Limited access:** Many people globally cannot open bank accounts or meet minimum requirements for financial services.
- **Delay and inefficiency:** Cross‚Äëborder settlements and loans can take days, incurring high fees along the way.
- **Opacity and custodial risk:** Users must trust institutions to remain solvent, secure, and fair.

DeFi eliminates these barriers by replacing human discretion with transparent, automated smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection can access financial services, and asset flows can be audited, verified, and settled in real time.

For Moony, DeFi is not an optional side use case, it is the natural extension of its core ethos: a trust‚Äëminimized, publicly verifiable, and composable asset that empowers global users without intermediaries.

#### Moony's Advantage

Moony possesses three core attributes that make it a natural fit for decentralized finance:

- **Composable and Permissionless:** Moony can integrate with any Solana‚Äëbased DeFi protocol without approvals or gatekeeping, allowing it to serve as collateral, liquidity in AMMs/DEXs, or a medium of exchange. Each new integration compounds Moony's utility and strengthens the network effect.
- **Transparent and Predictable Supply:** With a fixed supply of 21,000,000 and a fully on‚Äëchain reserve contract, Moony provides deterministic issuance and verifiable scarcity. This reduces collateral risk, avoids inflationary surprises, and builds confidence in Moony as a trust‚Äëminimized, reliable asset.
- **SPL Standard and Interoperability:** As an SPL token, Moony is natively compatible with the Solana DeFi ecosystem. It can move seamlessly between wallets, DEXs, lending protocols, and automated strategies, enabling fluid composability and frictionless circulation across the network.

Together, these properties make Moony a credible building block for DeFi, ready to flow through lending markets, liquidity pools, and programmable financial products without reliance on any single platform.

#### Potential Applications

Moony's utility in DeFi will expand organically as adoption grows and protocols integrate the asset. 

Potential use cases include:

- **Liquidity Pools and Swaps:** Moony can be deposited into automated market makers (AMMs) or decentralized exchanges (DEXs), allowing permissionless swaps and contributing to price discovery and market depth.
- **Collateralized Lending and Borrowing:** Holders can supply Moony as collateral to borrow stablecoins or other assets. This allows users to unlock liquidity without selling, while protocols gain access to a scarce, verifiable asset.
- **Yield Opportunities and Incentive Programs:** Liquidity mining, staking rewards, or protocol incentives can encourage Moony holders to actively participate in ecosystem growth, reinforcing both liquidity and visibility.

These use cases illustrate how one asset can power multiple layers of the financial stack, enabling both basic interactions and complex, high‚Äëorder products.

Moony's integration into DeFi is a natural expression of its design principles. By combining verifiable scarcity, SPL‚Äëstandard interoperability, and permissionless integration, Moony has the potential to become a durable building block for decentralized finance. Each DeFi integration strengthens the ecosystem, extending Moony's role from peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer digital cash into a global, self‚Äësustaining network for internet capital markets.

### Brand Kit

![Placeholder](/placeholder-color.png)

Moony's visual identity is designed to be simple, expressive, and open, a reflection of its role as a decentralized public asset that belongs to everyone. This page defines the core name, symbol, and usage conventions that ensure Moony is represented consistently across applications, communications, and interfaces. 

<img src="/Logos/text logo (light).svg" alt="Moony Text Logo - Light Version" style="max-width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 40px auto;">

The name Moony blends two ideas: moon and money. It draws from the playful, aspirational language of internet culture, where assets are said to "go to the moon", while also pointing directly to Moony's function as a new form of digital value. 

The name is intentionally simple, memorable, and shareable. Its memetic resonance makes it easy to adopt in conversation, while its grounding in principled, open value infrastructure signals credibility and long‚Äëterm vision. Moony is as much a cultural asset as it is a technical one.

#### Typography

The Moony wordmark uses the typeface Blanquotey, chosen for its clean geometry, high legibility, and modern character. Its lowercase styling conveys approachability and simplicity, aligning with Moony's open and memetic ethos while preserving institutional clarity. This typeface should be used when reproducing the Moony logotype or developing visual assets that reference the brand name in stylized form.

#### Icon Design

Moony's icon is deliberately minimal, yet layered with symbolic meaning, crafted to express both functional clarity and conceptual depth across any medium.

- **Moon Over Horizon:** The central form evokes a moon rising above a horizon, an allusion to Moony's namesake and growth. The horizontal line grounds the symbol, suggesting stability and foundational integrity, while the ascending shape implies forward motion and open-ended potential.

- **Binary Reference:** When rotated, the icon resembles a "1" and "0," subtly invoking binary code. This visual echo underscores Moony's digital origin and inherent programmability, positioning it as a native asset of internet capital markets. 

- **Market Semantics:** In trading contexts, the icon can be interpreted as denoting "over," "above," or directional movement, suggesting upward price momentum along Moony's bonding curve. This reflects its dynamic economic model, where adoption, integration, and transaction flow drive emergent market value.

The symbol is optimized for clarity at small sizes, performing reliably in both light and dark themes. Its simplicity ensures broad adaptability, while its layered references reinforce Moony's identity as both a technical primitive and an enduring digital brand.

#### Usage Guidelines

Moony can be represented using the Unicode character ‚çú (U+235C "APL Functional Symbol Circle Underbar") to indicate quantities, similar to how the $ symbol denotes U.S. dollars.

**Usage Examples:**

* ‚çú100 for one hundred Moony tokens
* ‚çú0.5 for half a Moony token
* "Tip them ‚çú2 for the post"
* "The pool contains ‚çú8,250"

#### Download Logos

These resources are provided to make it simple for developers, designers, and community members to integrate Moony's identity into wallets, applications, media, and promotional materials without friction.

## Welcome to Moony

Moony is a decentralized digital asset designed to facilitate permissionless transactions without intermediaries. It is deployed as a fixed-supply token on the Solana blockchain, with all issuance governed entirely by an immutable smart contract.

::: tip Disclaimer
This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial or investment advice. Moony is a decentralized digital asset issued and governed by an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain. The protocol operates autonomously and cannot be altered or controlled by any party. No company or formal organization is responsible for Moony's performance or value. Participants engage with the Moony protocol at their own discretion and are encouraged to conduct independent research and seek professional advice before interacting with blockchain-based systems.

## Tokenomics

Moony has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. New tokens are issued exclusively through a reserve contract deployed on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to mint Moony by depositing USDC, a US dollar stablecoin issued by Circle Inc.

The Moony reserve contract holds all user deposits as onchain liquidity, enabling redemptions and anchoring supply in verifiable value. Token pricing is determined by a bonding curve, a deterministic function that increases cost as more tokens are minted.

**Key Properties:**

- **Transparent:** Issuance follows deterministic onchain logic, with real-time visibility into price and supply
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint Moony by interacting directly with the reserve contract, with no approvals or intermediaries required  
- **Proof of Liquidity:** Capital used to mint Moony remains in the reserve, supporting redemptions and ensuring verifiable backing

This model, referred to as Proof of Liquidity (PoL), replaces energy-intensive mining with a capital-based issuance mechanism. Instead of consuming electricity, users deposit capital directly into the network, where it remains onchain as liquidity.

## Community

Moony operates as a public good on the Solana blockchain. There is no company, central team, or official roadmap. Instead, Moony grows through the initiative of independent contributors: developers, creators, product builders, educators, and everyday users who see value in a monetary system that belongs to no one and works for everyone.

The protocol is designed to function autonomously, with smart contracts handling all core operations including token issuance, pricing, and reserve management. This ensures the system operates predictably without requiring ongoing governance or administrative intervention.

# P2P Payments

Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments represent Moony’s most direct utility: enabling value transfer between individuals without intermediaries. By combining a credibly fixed supply with on-chain settlement, Moony delivers global digital cash with finality, transparency, and negligible fees.

## Why It Matters

Legacy payment systems rely on layered intermediaries such as banks, processors, or card networks, each introducing cost, latency, and potential for control or exclusion. Transactions can be delayed, reversed, or denied entirely, with entire regions excluded from participation.

Moony’s P2P model is different:

- **Direct settlement:** Transfers occur directly on-chain between sender and recipient, with no custodial middleman.
- **Trust minimization:** Settlement rules are enforced by code, not dependent on counterparties.

- **Censorship resistance:** Valid transactions are processed so long as participants can access the network.
- **Global accessibility:** Anyone with internet access and a compatible wallet can participate.

## Global Scalability

To make P2P viable at scale, both cost and throughput must support everyday usage. These characteristics make Moony suitable for daily transactions, not just high-value transfers. Moony launches on Solana to meet these requirements:

- **Low Fees:** Typical transfers cost fractions of a cent, with fees known at submission.
- **Throughput & latency:** Solana’s high-performance network supports rapid confirmations without congestion.
- **Composability:** The same infrastructure powering P2P also enables micropayments, streaming, and automated settlement.

Together, these properties make Moony credible for daily payments, not just occasional high‑value transactions.

## Financial Inclusion

Billions of people remain underserved, or entirely excluded, by traditional payment systems. In many regions, the absence of reliable banking infrastructure leaves individuals unable to store value securely, send money across borders, or participate in even the most basic forms of commerce. 

Where banking does exist, high fees, slow settlement times, and rigid requirements place meaningful participation out of reach for many. Cross‑border remittances can take days to arrive, cost double‑digit percentages in fees, and are often impractical for small amounts, limiting economic mobility and reinforcing systemic barriers.

Moony addresses these challenges:

- **Open access:** Anyone with a smartphone can receive Moony without bank accounts or gatekeepers.
- **Remittance:** Affordable, near-instant settlement for cross-border payments.
- **Commerce:** Merchants and creators can accept payments without card fees or chargebacks.
- **Availability:** Operates 24/7, unaffected by weekends or holidays, like traditional systems.

Moony’s peer‑to‑peer architecture offers a different path: one that bypasses the bottlenecks of legacy finance and extends open participation to anyone with a mobile device. By removing intermediaries and leveraging low‑cost, high‑speed blockchain settlement, Moony makes direct digital transactions viable at a scale and inclusivity level traditional rails cannot match.

## Interoperable Access

Moony is issued as an SPL token on the Solana blockchain, ensuring that it is fully interoperable and not bound to any single interface or platform. From the moment it is minted, Moony is part of a broader composable ecosystem where users and developers can freely move, store, and integrate the asset without permission. This open design not only reinforces Moony’s role as decentralized digital cash but also guarantees that its utility can expand organically across a variety of independent applications.

Several key properties enable this interoperability:

- **Wallet compatibility:** Any Solana‑compatible wallet that supports SPL tokens can hold and transfer Moony. Users are free to manage their balances in the interface of their choice, rather than being locked into a single custodial or proprietary app.
- **Composability:** Moony can be added to payment apps, point‑of‑sale systems, bots, and custodial or non‑custodial services with minimal friction. Developers can plug into Moony the same way they support any other SPL token, allowing it to circulate naturally through the ecosystem.

Because Moony is permissionless and composable by design, its peer‑to‑peer utility is not constrained to a single application. The token can flow seamlessly between wallets, payment interfaces, and future onchain services, creating a foundation for global accessibility and financial inclusion as the network of integrations grows.

## Flipcash Infrastructure

Moony and it's reserve contract were launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash Inc., an independent third-party company. Flipcash does not maintain control over Moony or its reserve contract, nor can it alter the protocol's issuance, pricing, or supply mechanisms. These parameters are defined entirely by Moony's immutable smart contract, ensuring the protocol remains open and permissionless from the start.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public interface for interacting directly with the Moony Reserve Contract. Through its mobile app, users can seamlessly buy Moony or sell Moony for USDC. Flipcash also offers an industry-leading, trustless peer-to-peer payments experience, giving users a seamless way to transact with Moony.

### Flipcash Enables Users To:

- **Interact With Reserve:** Seamlessly convert between Moony and USDC through an intuitive interface.
- **Send P2P Payments:** Instantly use Moony as digital cash where you can hand it to someone or send it as a link.

While Flipcash provides the first front end to access the Moony reserve contract, Moony is not limited to any single platform. Designed as a digital public good, Moony can be integrated into any third party platform, protocol,wallet, or app, ensuring broad utility, composability, and adoption.

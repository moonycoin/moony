# Getting Started

Moony is a decentralized digital asset designed to facilitate permissionless transactions without intermediaries. It is deployed as a fixed-supply token on the Solana blockchain, with all issuance governed entirely by an immutable smart contract. This design ensures full transparency, removes all forms of discretionary control, and enables open participation in emerging internet capital markets.

This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial or investment advice. Moony is a decentralized digital asset issued and governed by an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain. The protocol operates autonomously and cannot be altered or controlled by any party. No company or formal organization is responsible for Moony’s performance or value. Participants engage with the Moony protocol at their own discretion and are encouraged to conduct independent research and seek professional advice before interacting with blockchain-based systems.

## Supply & Distribution

Moony has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. New tokens are issued exclusively through a reserve contract deployed on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to mint Moony by depositing USDC, a US dollar stablecoin issued by Circle Inc. This design eliminates discretionary allocation and central oversight, replacing them with a transparent, rules-based issuance process.

The Moony reserve contract holds all user deposits as onchain liquidity, enabling redemptions and anchoring supply in verifiable value. Token pricing is determined by a bonding curve, a deterministic function that increases cost as more tokens are minted, ensuring that issuance is transparent, demand-driven, and algorithmically defined.

- **Transparent:** Issuance follows deterministic onchain logic, with real-time visibility into price and supply.
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint Moony by interacting directly with the reserve contract, with no approvals or intermediaries required.
- **Proof of Liquidity:** Capital used to mint Moony remains in the reserve, supporting redemptions and ensuring verifiable backing.

This model, referred to as Proof of Liquidity (PoL), replaces energy-intensive mining with a capital-based issuance mechanism. Instead of consuming electricity, users deposit capital directly into the network, where it remains onchain as liquidity. This model aligns issuance with demand, reduces inefficiencies, and ensures that all circulating Moony remains transparently and verifiably supported.

## Utility Ecosystem

Moony is built to serve as a foundational asset for a composable, internet-native economy. It integrates seamlessly with wallets, applications, and decentralized protocols, allowing users and developers to move and exchange value freely without relying on centralized infrastructure or permissioned systems.

As an SPL token on Solana, Moony can be embedded directly into wallets, dApps, marketplaces, creator tools, and DeFi protocols. From peer-to-peer transfers and micropayments to automated commerce and financial coordination, Moony unlocks a broad spectrum of real-world use cases.

Moony supports use cases including:

- **P2P payments:** Send and receive Moony instantly with near-zero fees across wallets and messaging platforms.
- **Micropayments:** Power in-app transactions and per-use monetization at sub-cent scale.
- **Content monetization:** Enable creators to receive support directly from audiences without intermediaries or platform tolls.
- **Machine-to-machine commerce:** Fuel autonomous agents and IoT devices with programmable, low-latency settlement.
- **DeFi integrations:** Use Moony as a composable asset in lending markets, automated market makers, and staking protocols.

Moony combines global accessibility, minimal transaction costs, and programmable infrastructure to support new monetization models while enabling direct, peer-to-peer exchange of value. Its design empowers developers, creators, and everyday users to transact and build without intermediaries.

## Decentralized Community

Moony is not controlled by any single organization or governing body. It is a decentralized protocol designed to function as a public good. Open, accessible, and governed by transparent code, its growth is shaped by the individuals and communities who engage with it. As participation expands, the ecosystem evolves through open collaboration.

Participation is open to all. Whether you’re a developer, creator, organizer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to get involved. The network grows through grassroots energy and shared values, not central control. By contributing time, talent, or ideas, participants help expand Moony’s reach and strengthen its foundation.

- **Develop and integrate:** Developers can build with Moony by integrating it into apps or platforms, extending its functionality across tools and services.
- **Create and transact:** Creators can accept Moony for goods, services, or content, using it to enable direct community support and new monetization models.
- **Organize and connect:** Community organizers can launch regional or thematic groups based on shared language, interests, or goals, helping grow local adoption.
- **Educate and onboard:** Contributors can translate materials, host real-world events, or create resources that help others understand and use Moony.
- **Share and express:** Artists, memers, and storytellers can create content, videos, and social media that spread awareness, shape culture, and amplify Moony’s narrative.

Over time, independent contributors of all kinds are expected to emerge and help drive the Moony ecosystem forward. From nonprofits and traditional startups to community-led collectives and open-source initiatives, a diverse network of participants can shape its evolution. None of them own or control the protocol. Each plays a role in extending its reach and resilience, and all can collectively benefit from the value created as adoption grows.

## Flipcash Infrastructure

Moony was launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash Inc., an independent third-party company focused on simplifying access to digital assets. Flipcash does not control Moony or its reserve contract, nor does it influence the protocol’s issuance, pricing, or supply. These mechanics are defined entirely by Moony’s immutable smart contract, ensuring the protocol remains open and permissionless from the start.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public interface for interacting directly with the Moony reserve contract. Through a streamlined mobile app, users can seamlessly mint new supply or redeem Moony. The app also delivers an industry-leading trustless, peer-to-peer payments experience, helping bring Moony’s utility to everyday users.

The Flipcash app enables:

- **Direct minting and redemption:** Seamlessly convert between Moony and USDC by interacting with the reserve contract through an intuitive interface.
- **Instant peer-to-peer transfers:** Send Moony to friends, contacts, or any compatible wallet with minimal friction.
- **QR code and link-based payments:** Use scannable codes and shareable links to simplify sending and receiving payments across platforms.

::: tip
While Flipcash provides the first front end to access the Moony reserve contract, Moony is not limited to any single platform. Built as a public good on open infrastructure, Moony can be integrated by any app, wallet, or protocol. As an SPL-standard asset, it is fully compatible with the broader Solana ecosystem, ensuring broad utility, composability, and adoption across decentralized services.

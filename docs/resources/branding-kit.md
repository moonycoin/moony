# Branding Kit

Moony’s visual identity is designed to be simple, expressive, and open. This page outlines the name, symbol, and usage conventions that define how Moony appears across applications and interfaces. Every element is crafted to reinforce Moony’s mission as a decentralized, accessible public asset.


The name “Moony” blends two ideas: Moon and Money. It evokes the playful energy of internet culture, where assets are said to “go to the moon,” while also signaling Moony’s role as a new kind of digital money. The name carries memetic cultural resonance, reflecting the emergent and often symbolic nature of cryptocurrency itself. It is accessible and shareable, but grounded in a principled commitment to open monetary infrastructure.

## Icon Design

Moony’s symbol is simple yet multilayered in meaning. At a glance, it appears as a crescent moon over a horizon. But it encodes deeper symbolism:

* **Moon over a horizon**: Visually suggests Moony’s namesake and evokes cyclical, natural growth. The horizon line hints at stability and groundedness, while the rising moon suggests potential and movement.
* **Binary code**: The arrangement echoes the 1’s and 0’s of binary logic, highlighting Moony’s nature as a digital asset and signaling its programmability.
* **Trading notation**: In some charting and trading environments, the symbol is interpreted as “over” or “above,” consistent with the token’s upward trajectory along its bonding curve and the open, emergent systems it supports.

These overlapping symbols converge in a minimal form that is both distinctive and adaptable. The icon is designed to be legible at small sizes and works well across light and dark modes.

## Usage Guidelines


Moony can be represented using the ⍜ symbol (Unicode: U+235C “APL Functional Symbol Circle Star”) to indicate quantities of the token, similar to how the $ symbol denotes U.S. dollars.

**Usage Examples:**

* ⍜100 — one hundred Moony tokens
* ⍜0.5 — half a Moony token
* "Tip them ⍜2 for the post"
* "The pool contains ⍜8,250"

**Guidelines:**

* Do not insert a space between the symbol and the number (write ⍜100, not ⍜ 100)
* Do not pluralize the unit (write ⍜100, not "100 moonies")
* Use the symbol in UI and communications where concise value representation is helpful

This notation helps reinforce Moony as a usable unit of account and supports consistent presentation across interfaces.

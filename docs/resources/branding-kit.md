# Icon Design

Moony’s visual identity is designed to be simple, expressive, and open, a reflection of its role as a decentralized public asset that belongs to everyone. This page defines the core name, symbol, and usage conventions that ensure Moony is represented consistently across applications, communications, and interfaces. 

The name Moony blends two ideas: moon and money. It draws from the playful, aspirational language of internet culture, where assets are said to “go to the moon”, while also pointing directly to Moony’s function as a new form of digital value. 

The name is intentionally simple, memorable, and shareable. Its memetic resonance makes it easy to adopt in conversation, while its grounding in principled, open value infrastructure signals credibility and long‑term vision. Moony is as much a cultural asset as it is a technical one.

Moony's icon symbol is simple yet multilayered in meaning. 

* **Moon over a horizon**: Represents Moony’s namesake and evokes cyclical, organic growth. The horizon suggests stability and grounding; the rising moon conveys potential and movement.
* **Binary code**: The arrangement subtly recalls the 1’s and 0’s of binary code, referencing Moony’s digital nature and inherent programmability.
* **Trading notation**: The symbol can be interpreted in some contexts as “over” or “above,” echoing Moony’s upward price trajectory along its bonding curve and its participation in open, emergent markets.

The icon is deliberately designed for clarity at small sizes, working equally well in light or dark themes. Its simplicity ensures adaptability across a wide variety of mediums, from digital UIs to printed materials.

## Usage Guidelines

Moony can be represented using the Unicode character ⍜ (U+235C “APL Functional Symbol Circle Underbar”) to indicate quantities, similar to how the $ symbol denotes U.S. dollars.

**Usage Examples:**

* ⍜100 for one hundred Moony tokens
* ⍜0.5 for half a Moony token
* "Tip them ⍜2 for the post"
* "The pool contains ⍜8,250"

**Guidelines:**

* Do not insert a space between the symbol and the number (write ⍜100, not ⍜ 100)
* Do not pluralize the unit (write ⍜100, not "100 moonies")
* Use the symbol in UI and communications where concise value representation is helpful

This notation strengthens Moony’s position as a functional unit of account, supporting both usability and brand recognition.

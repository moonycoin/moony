# Brand Design

Moony’s visual identity is designed to be simple, expressive, and open, a reflection of its role as a decentralized public asset that belongs to everyone. This page defines the core name, symbol, and usage conventions that ensure Moony is represented consistently across applications, communications, and interfaces.

The name Moony blends two ideas: moon and money. It draws from the playful, aspirational language of internet culture, where assets are said to “go to the moon”, while also pointing directly to Moony’s function as a new form of digital value. 

The name is intentionally simple, memorable, and shareable. Its memetic resonance makes it easy to adopt in conversation, while its grounding in principled, open value infrastructure signals credibility and long‑term vision. Moony is as much a cultural asset as it is a technical one.

## Icon Design

Moony’s icon is deliberately minimal, yet layered with symbolic meaning, crafted to express both functional clarity and conceptual depth across any medium.

- **Moon Over Horizon:** The central form evokes a moon rising above a horizon, an allusion to Moony’s namesake and growth. The horizontal line grounds the symbol, suggesting stability and foundational integrity, while the ascending shape implies forward motion and open-ended potential.

- **Binary Reference:** When rotated, the icon resembles a “1” and “0,” subtly invoking binary code. This visual echo underscores Moony’s digital origin and inherent programmability, positioning it as a native asset of internet capital markets. 

- **Market Semantics:** In trading contexts, the icon can be interpreted as denoting “over,” “above,” or directional movement, suggesting upward price momentum along Moony’s bonding curve. This reflects its dynamic economic model, where adoption, integration, and transaction flow drive emergent market value.

The symbol is optimized for clarity at small sizes, performing reliably in both light and dark themes. Its simplicity ensures broad adaptability, while its layered references reinforce Moony’s identity as both a technical primitive and an enduring digital brand.

## Usage Guidelines

Moony can be represented using the Unicode character ⍜ (U+235C “APL Functional Symbol Circle Underbar”) to indicate quantities, similar to how the $ symbol denotes U.S. dollars.

**Usage Examples:**

* ⍜100 for one hundred Moony tokens
* ⍜0.5 for half a Moony token
* "Tip them ⍜2 for the post"
* "The pool contains ⍜8,250"

**Guidelines:**

* Do not insert a space between the symbol and the number (write ⍜100, not ⍜ 100)
* Do not pluralize the unit (write ⍜100, not "100 moonies")
* Use the symbol in UI and communications where concise value representation is helpful

This notation strengthens Moony’s position as a functional unit of account, supporting both usability and brand recognition.

# Community

Moony is more than a token. It is a shared movement for open value exchange. Its core infrastructure is open, permissionless, and immutable so it can endure as a public good for anyone, anywhere. With no company, central team, or fixed roadmap, the future is written by the people who build upon it: developers, creators, educators, merchants, and everyday users who believe in a system that belongs to no one and empowers everyone.

From inception, Moony’s governance is encoded in a transparent, immutable smart contract backed by a public onchain Reserve Contract. No entity can alter its supply, pricing, or rules of operation. Moony’s trajectory depends not on central oversight, but on participants who build, use, and advocate for the asset in ways that reflect open access and permissionless participation.

## Stakeholders

Moony is permissionless infrastructure. Anyone can participate without approvals or gatekeeping. The network thrives when individuals and organizations apply skills, resources, and creativity to expand reach and utility. Independent action compounds into ecosystem growth.

- **Build:** Integrate Moony into apps, platforms, and tools to unlock new use cases across the digital economy.
- **Transact:** Accept Moony for goods, services, or content to enable direct support and alternative monetization.
- **Organize:** Launch regional or thematic groups around shared languages, interests, or goals to drive local adoption.
- **Educate:** Produce resources or host events that help others understand, use, and build with Moony.
- **Express:** Use storytelling, memes, and art to spread awareness and shape Moony’s cultural narrative.

Participation is open and merit based. Contributions that improve utility, security, documentation, or accessibility are encouraged to be shared publicly so others can reuse and extend them.

## Incentive Structure

Moony’s economic architecture aligns individual incentives with collective growth. The Proof of Liquidity model mints new tokens only when participants deposit USDC into the Reserve Contract, which expands liquidity and distributes supply in direct response to demand. Deposits remain onchain as verifiable liquidity that supports redemptions and deepens market depth over time.

Pricing follows a bonding curve, a deterministic onchain function that increases the cost of newly minted tokens as adoption grows through integrations, transaction volume, or broader use. This creates direct alignment: contributors who expand utility or strengthen infrastructure improve network resilience and may benefit from the appreciation of assets acquired earlier at lower marginal cost.

There is no central treasury, corporate owner, or administrative control. Value accrues organically to those who act by building, integrating, educating, or transacting. In this model, network growth is self-reinforcing: individual contribution and collective value creation move together.



- **Integration:** Each new integration that supports Moony increases accessibility, deepens liquidity, and drives organic demand.
- **Utility:** Adoption by merchants and platforms expands real world use and strengthens transactional velocity.
- **Participation:** Community-led efforts introduce new users, reinforce shared values, and broaden the ecosystem’s reach.

## Public Good

Moony is a public good, sustained and advanced by communities that choose to engage with it. Its evolution is shaped not by central mandates, but by collective action on a shared foundation.

Developers may integrate Moony into applications and infrastructure. Creators may produce educational or cultural content. Merchants may adopt it as a medium of exchange. New organizations may form to expand awareness and accessibility. Every contribution, whether technical, educational, economic, or cultural, extends Moony’s reach and resilience.

The next step belongs to the individual. Through code, conversation, commerce, or community, each action strengthens the network and reinforces Moony’s role as a decentralized, internet native form of digital cash.

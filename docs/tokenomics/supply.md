# Supply

Moony operates on a fundamentally different economic model than traditional cryptocurrencies. Rather than relying on energy-intensive mining or inflationary token creation, Moony implements a **fixed maximum supply** of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable on-chain logic.

## Fixed Supply Architecture

### **Maximum Supply: 21 Million Tokens**
- **Hard cap**: No more than 21 million Moony tokens can ever exist
- **Immutable logic**: This limit is permanently encoded in smart contracts
- **No exceptions**: No team, treasury, or governance can increase this cap
- **Mathematical certainty**: The supply limit is mathematically enforced

### **Why 21 Million?**
The 21 million supply cap is designed to:
- **Create scarcity**: Limited supply drives value appreciation
- **Prevent inflation**: No new tokens can dilute existing holders
- **Ensure fairness**: Equal opportunity for all participants
- **Build confidence**: Predictable, transparent supply mechanics

## Supply Distribution Model

### **No Pre-allocation**
Unlike traditional token launches, Moony has:
- ❌ **No team allocation**: 0% reserved for founders or developers
- ❌ **No treasury**: 0% held by any central entity
- ❌ **No investor allocation**: 0% sold to venture capitalists
- ❌ **No airdrops**: 0% distributed to early supporters

### **100% Community-Owned**
- ✅ **All tokens**: Remain in the reserve contract until minted
- ✅ **Fair access**: Anyone can mint tokens by depositing USDC
- ✅ **Transparent**: All supply movements are on-chain and verifiable
- ✅ **Permissionless**: No gatekeepers or approval processes

## Supply Mechanics

### **Initial State**
At launch, the supply structure is:
- **Circulating supply**: 0 tokens
- **Reserve contract**: 21 million tokens (unissued)
- **Total supply**: 21 million tokens (fixed)

### **Supply Issuance**
New tokens enter circulation only when:
1. **Users deposit USDC** into the reserve contract
2. **Smart contract calculates** the appropriate Moony amount
3. **Bonding curve determines** the exact exchange rate
4. **Tokens are minted** and sent to the user

### **Supply Redemption**
Tokens can be redeemed for USDC when:
1. **Users send Moony** back to the reserve contract
2. **Smart contract calculates** the USDC equivalent
3. **Bonding curve determines** the redemption rate
4. **USDC is returned** to the user

## Economic Implications

### **Deflationary Pressure**
As adoption grows:
- **Demand increases**: More users want to acquire Moony
- **Supply remains fixed**: No new tokens can be created
- **Price appreciation**: Bonding curve ensures higher costs
- **Value preservation**: Existing holders benefit from scarcity

### **Liquidity Backing**
Every circulating Moony token is:
- **Fully backed**: By USDC held in the reserve contract
- **Redeemable**: Can be exchanged for USDC at any time
- **Transparent**: All backing is on-chain and verifiable
- **Secure**: No counterparty risk or trust required

## Supply Transparency

### **On-Chain Verification**
All supply information is:
- **Publicly visible**: Anyone can inspect the reserve contract
- **Real-time updated**: Changes are reflected immediately
- **Mathematically provable**: No hidden mechanics or backdoors
- **Audit-friendly**: Clear, verifiable supply logic

### **Supply Metrics**
Key supply indicators include:
- **Total supply**: Always 21 million (fixed)
- **Circulating supply**: Tokens held by users
- **Reserve balance**: USDC backing the circulating supply
- **Minting price**: Current cost to acquire new tokens
- **Redemption rate**: Current USDC value per token

## Long-Term Supply Stability

### **Permanent Scarcity**
Moony's supply model ensures:
- **Enduring value**: Scarcity increases over time
- **Predictable economics**: No surprise inflation or dilution
- **Store of value**: Reliable long-term asset characteristics
- **Network effects**: Value grows with adoption

### **Sustainable Economics**
The fixed supply creates:
- **Incentive alignment**: All participants benefit from growth
- **Long-term thinking**: No short-term supply manipulation
- **Community focus**: Success depends on utility, not speculation
- **Resilient foundation**: Strong economic fundamentals

# Getting Started

::: tip Disclaimer
This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Moony is a decentralized digital asset issued and governed by an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain. The protocol operates autonomously and cannot be altered or controlled by any party. No company or formal organization is responsible for Moony's performance or value. Participants engage with the Moony protocol at their own discretion and are encouraged to conduct independent research and seek professional advice before interacting with blockchain-based systems.

## Tokenomics

Moony has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. New tokens are issued exclusively through a reserve contract deployed on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to mint Moony by depositing USDC, a US dollar stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group, Inc. 

No tokens were allocated to any team, treasury, investors, or insiders. Instead, the supply remains unissued until users interact with the contract. This design eliminates discretionary allocation and central oversight, replacing them with a transparent, rules-based issuance process.

The Moony reserve contract holds all user deposits as onchain liquidity, enabling redemptions and anchoring supply in verifiable value. Token pricing is determined by a bonding curve, a deterministic function that increases cost as more tokens are minted, ensuring that issuance is transparent, demand-driven, and algorithmically defined.

This model, referred to as Proof of Liquidity (PoL), replaces energy-intensive mining with a capital-based issuance mechanism. Instead of consuming electricity, users deposit capital directly into the network, where it remains onchain as liquidity. This model aligns issuance with demand, reduces inefficiencies, and ensures that all circulating Moony remains transparently and verifiably supported.

### Key Properties:

- **Fixed Supply:** Moony has a hard cap of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. No additional tokens can ever be created.
- **Fair Distribution:** The entire supply is deposited into the reserve at launch. No allocation is given to any team, treasury, investors, or insiders.
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint Moony by interacting directly with the reserve contract, with no approvals or intermediaries required.
- **Proof of Liquidity:** Capital used to mint Moony remains in the reserve, supporting redemptions and ensuring liquidity to support the market as it grows.
- **Bonding Curve:** Token pricing is governed by a deterministic bonding curve, meaning the price increases as more tokens are minted. This ensures that supply issuance is aligned with real demand.

## Composable Ecosystem

Moony is the foundational asset for a programmable, internet-native economy. It enables seamless and decentralized value exchange across applications, wallets, and protocols without relying on centralized infrastructure or gatekeepers.

As a composable SPL token on Solana, Moony can be natively integrated into smart contracts, payment flows, and financial primitives. Its low-cost and programmable design opens new ways to coordinate, transact, and build. This creates the foundation for an open ecosystem of apps and services powered by a shared digital asset.

Moony combines global accessibility with negligible fees and onchain transparency to support an open economic layer for the internet. Its architecture enables permissionless integration and frictionless value exchange, empowering developers, creators, and users to participate directly in a shared financial future.

### Potential use-cases:

- **P2P Payments:** Enable global, permissionless transfers with near-zero fees and minimal latency. Moony empowers direct value exchange without intermediaries, expanding access to digital economies worldwide.
- **Micropayments:** Power sub-cent transactions and unlock new monetization models, from one-time purchases to continuous streaming payments between users, apps, or autonomous agents.
- **DeFi Integration:** Use Moony as a composable asset in lending markets, AMMs, staking protocols, and other decentralized financial infrastructure.

## Decentralized Community

Moony is not controlled by any organization or governing body. It operates as a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to serve as a public good. Open, permissionless, and governed by immutable code, Moony's evolution is driven by the individuals and communities who participate in its ecosystem. As adoption grows, the protocol's utility and reach expand organically through collective engagement and voluntary contribution.

Participation is open to all. Whether you're a developer, creator, organizer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute. Moony grows through grassroots energy and shared values, not central control. By offering time, talent, or ideas, participants help expand the network and strengthen its foundation.

- **Develop & Integrate:** Builders can extend Moony's utility by integrating it into apps, platforms, and tools, enabling new use cases across the digital economy.
- **Create & Transact:** Creators can accept Moony for goods, services, or content, unlocking direct community support and alternative monetization models.
- **Organize & Connect:** Community leaders can launch regional or thematic groups around shared languages, interests, or goals to drive local adoption.
- **Educate & Onboard:** Contributors can host events or produce educational resources that help others understand and use Moony.
- **Share & Express:** Artists, storytellers, and memers can craft content that spreads awareness, shapes culture, and amplifies Moony's narrative.

As adoption increases, a diverse ecosystem of independent contributors is expected to form, including startups, nonprofits, open-source projects, and grassroots collectives. While none control the protocol, each plays a role in expanding its reach and strengthening its resilience.

## Flipcash Infrastructure

Moony was launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash Inc., an independent third-party company. Flipcash does not maintain control over Moony or its reserve contract, nor can it alter the protocol's issuance, pricing, or supply mechanisms. These parameters are defined entirely by Moony's immutable smart contract, ensuring the protocol remains open and permissionless from the start.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public interface for interacting directly with the Moony reserve contract. Through its mobile app, users can seamlessly acquire Moony or redeem tokens for USDC. The app also offers an industry-leading, trustless peer-to-peer payments experience, giving users a seamless way to transact with Moony.

### The Flipcash app enables users to:

- **Interact With Reserve:** Seamlessly convert between MOONY and USDC through an intuitive interface.
- **Send P2P Payments:** Use QR code based digital cash and URL links to simplify sending and receiving payments.

::: tip
While Flipcash provides the first front end to access the Moony reserve contract, Moony is not limited to any single platform. Designed as a digital public good, Moony can be integrated into any third party platform, protocol,wallet, or app. As an SPL-standard digital asset, it is fully compatible with the broader Solana ecosystem, ensuring broad utility, composability, and adoption.

## Tokenomics

The total supply is capped at 21 million tokens, enforced by a smart contract that cannot be altered or upgraded. There are no team allocations, no treasury reserves, and no private premines. Every token in circulation is minted under the same public rules, directly from a decentralized Reserve Contract deployed on Solana.

The Reserve Contract governs all token issuance and redemption. Users can mint Moony by depositing USDC, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin issued by Circle, into the Reserve Contract. Pricing is determined by a deterministic bonding curve that increases as circulating supply grows, ensuring that Moony’s distribution is entirely market-driven, demand-responsive, and algorithmically defined.

Moony’s approach replaces discretionary allocation with transparent rules. It eliminates intermediaries, gatekeepers, and the need for governance over monetary supply. Instead, it adopts a capital-based issuance model known as Proof of Liquidity (PoL), a mechanism that anchors every Moony token to value held onchain.

### Key Properties:

- **Fixed Supply:** The supply of Moony is capped at 21 million tokens. This cap is hard-coded into the Reserve Contract and cannot be changed.
- **Fair Distribution:** No tokens are premined or reserved for any team, treasury, founder, or investor. All tokens enter circulation via the same permissionless mechanism.
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint or redeem Moony through the Reserve Contract, without intermediaries, approvals, whitelisting, or KYC.
- **Proof of Liquidity:** All USDC deposited to mint Moony remains locked in the Reserve Contract as liquidity. This provides a source of redemption and public proof that supply is backed.
- **Bonding Curve:** Moony’s price is determined by an onchain bonding curve. The more tokens minted, the higher the price. When tokens are redeemed, price adjusts accordingly, ensuring alignment between supply and market demand.

## Decentralized Community

Moony is not controlled by any organization or governing body. It operates as a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to serve as a public good. Open, permissionless, and governed by immutable code, Moony’s growth is shaped by the individuals and communities who use and support it. As adoption grows, the protocol’s utility and reach expand organically through the voluntary efforts of individuals, communities, and independent projects.

Moony’s economic architecture is designed to reward that participation. Its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) model issues new tokens only when users deposit USDC into the reserve contract, expanding liquidity and distributing supply in direct response to demand. As usage grows, through integrations, transactions, or broader adoption, the price of newly minted tokens increases via the bonding curve, aligning incentives across the network. Those who help expand Moony’s reach also stand to benefit from the value they help create. Growing the network is not only a shared mission but also a self-reinforcing strategy. Every new integration, creator, or community that joins strengthens the ecosystem and amplifies the potential impact of every contribution.

Participation is open to all. Whether you’re a developer, creator, organizer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute. Moony grows through grassroots energy and shared values, not central control. By offering time, talent, or ideas, participants help expand the network and strengthen its foundation. A diverse ecosystem of independent contributors is expected to emerge, including startups, nonprofits, open-source projects, and grassroots collectives. While none control the protocol, each plays a role in expanding its reach and reinforcing its resilience.

### How To Contribute:

- **Build:** Integrate Moony into apps, platforms, and tools to unlock new use cases across the digital economy.
- **Transact:** Accept Moony for goods, services, or content to enable direct community support and alternative monetization.
- **Organize:** Launch regional or thematic groups around shared languages, interests, or goals to drive local adoption.
- **Educate:** Produce resources or host events that help others understand, use, and build with Moony.
- **Express:** Use storytelling, memes, and art to spread awareness and shape Moony’s cultural narrative.

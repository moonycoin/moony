# Getting Started

::: tip Disclaimer
This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Moony is a decentralized digital asset issued and governed by an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain. The protocol operates autonomously and cannot be altered or controlled by any party. No company or formal organization is responsible for Moony's performance or value. Participants engage with the Moony protocol at their own discretion and are encouraged to conduct independent research and seek professional advice before interacting with blockchain-based systems.

## Tokenomics

Moony has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. New tokens are issued exclusively through a reserve contract deployed on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to mint Moony by depositing USDC, a US dollar stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group, Inc. 

No tokens were allocated to any team, treasury, investors, or insiders. Instead, the supply remains unissued until users interact with the contract. This design eliminates discretionary allocation and central oversight, replacing them with a transparent, rules-based issuance process.

The Moony reserve contract holds all user deposits as onchain liquidity, enabling redemptions and anchoring supply in verifiable value. Token pricing is determined by a bonding curve, a deterministic function that increases cost as more tokens are minted, ensuring that issuance is transparent, demand-driven, and algorithmically defined.

This model, referred to as Proof of Liquidity (PoL), replaces energy-intensive mining with a capital-based issuance mechanism. Instead of consuming electricity, users deposit capital directly into the network, where it remains onchain as liquidity. This model aligns issuance with demand, reduces inefficiencies, and ensures that all circulating Moony remains transparently and verifiably supported.

### Key Properties:

- **Fixed Supply:** Moony has a hard cap of 21 million tokens, enforced by immutable onchain logic. No additional tokens can ever be created.
- **Fair Distribution:** The entire supply is deposited into the reserve at launch. No allocation is given to any team, treasury, investors, or insiders.
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can mint Moony by interacting directly with the reserve contract, with no approvals or intermediaries required.
- **Proof of Liquidity:** Capital used to mint Moony remains in the reserve, supporting redemptions and ensuring liquidity to support the market as it grows.
- **Bonding Curve:** Token pricing is governed by a deterministic bonding curve, meaning the price increases as more tokens are minted. This ensures that supply issuance is aligned with real demand.

## Decentralized Community

Moony is not controlled by any organization or governing body. It operates as a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to serve as a public good. Open, permissionless, and governed by immutable code, Moony’s growth is shaped by the individuals and communities who use and support it. As adoption grows, the protocol’s utility and reach expand organically through the voluntary efforts of individuals, communities, and independent projects.

Moony’s economic architecture is designed to reward that participation. Its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) model issues new tokens only when users deposit USDC into the reserve contract, expanding liquidity and distributing supply in direct response to demand. As usage grows, through integrations, transactions, or broader adoption, the price of newly minted tokens increases via the bonding curve, aligning incentives across the network. Those who help expand Moony’s reach also stand to benefit from the value they help create. Growing the network is not only a shared mission but also a self-reinforcing strategy. Every new integration, creator, or community that joins strengthens the ecosystem and amplifies the potential impact of every contribution.

Participation is open to all. Whether you’re a developer, creator, organizer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute. Moony grows through grassroots energy and shared values, not central control. By offering time, talent, or ideas, participants help expand the network and strengthen its foundation. A diverse ecosystem of independent contributors is expected to emerge, including startups, nonprofits, open-source projects, and grassroots collectives. While none control the protocol, each plays a role in expanding its reach and reinforcing its resilience.

### How To Contribute:

- **Build:** Integrate Moony into apps, platforms, and tools to unlock new use cases across the digital economy.
- **Transact:** Accept Moony for goods, services, or content to enable direct community support and alternative monetization.
- **Organize:** Launch regional or thematic groups around shared languages, interests, or goals to drive local adoption.
- **Educate:** Produce resources or host events that help others understand, use, and build with Moony.
- **Express:** Use storytelling, memes, and art to spread awareness and shape Moony’s cultural narrative.

## Flipcash Infrastructure

Moony and it's reserve contract were launched using infrastructure developed by Flipcash Inc., an independent third-party company. Flipcash does not maintain control over Moony or its reserve contract, nor can it alter the protocol's issuance, pricing, or supply mechanisms. These parameters are defined entirely by Moony's immutable smart contract, ensuring the protocol remains open and permissionless from the start.

At launch, Flipcash provides the first public interface for interacting directly with the Moony reserve contract. Through its mobile app, users can seamlessly acquire Moony or redeem tokens for USDC. The app also offers an industry-leading, trustless peer-to-peer payments experience, giving users a seamless way to transact with Moony.

While Flipcash provides the first front end to access the Moony reserve contract, Moony is not limited to any single platform. Designed as a digital public good, Moony can be integrated into any third party platform, protocol,wallet, or app, ensuring broad utility, composability, and adoption.

### Flipcash Enables Users To:

- **Interact With Reserve:** Seamlessly convert between Moony and USDC through an intuitive interface.
- **Send P2P Payments:** Use QR code based digital cash and URL links to send and receive payments.

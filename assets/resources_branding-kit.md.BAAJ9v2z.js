This page defines the name, symbol, and usage conventions that shape how Moony appears across applications and interfaces. Each element reinforces Moony’s mission as a decentralized, accessible public asset.</p><p>The name <strong>“Moony”</strong> blends two ideas: <em>moon</em> and <em>money</em>. It channels the playful energy of cryptocurrency meme culture, where tokens “go to the moon&quot;, while signaling Moony’s purpose as digital cash.

At first glance, it appears as a crescent moon rising over a horizon. On closer inspection, it encodes several ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Moon above a horizon</strong> – Evokes natural cycles and long-term growth. The horizon line grounds the symbol, while the rising moon suggests upward motion and potential.</li><li><strong>Binary logic</strong> – The shape subtly recalls 1s and 0s, reinforcing Moony’s identity as programmable digital money.</li><li><strong>Trading notation</strong> – In technical charting, the symbol can be interpreted as &quot;over&quot; or &quot;above,&quot; echoing Moony’s bonding curve and upward economic motion.</li></ul><p>This icon is intentionally versatile, designed for clarity at small sizes, compatibility with light and dark themes, and easy use across interfaces.</p><h2 id="usage-guidelines" tabindex="-1">Usage Guidelines <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage-guidelines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usage Guidelines&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Moony can be represented with the ⍜ symbol (Unicode: U+235C “APL Functional Symbol Circle Star”) to denote token quantities, similar to how <code>$</code> is used for U.S. dollars.</p><h3 id="examples" tabindex="-1">Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Examples&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>⍜100 — one hundred Moony</li><li>⍜0.5 — half a Moony</li><li>“Tip them ⍜2 for the post”</li><li>“The pool contains ⍜8,250”</li></ul><h3 id="guidelines" tabindex="-1">Guidelines <a class="header-anchor" href="#guidelines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Guidelines&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Do <strong>not</strong> add a space between the symbol and the number (<code>⍜100</code>, not <code>⍜ 100</code>)</li><li>Do <strong>not</strong> pluralize the unit (use <code>⍜100</code>, not <code>100 moonies</code>)</li><li>Use the symbol wherever concise value representation enhances clarity or UX</li></ul><p>This convention reinforces Moony’s role as a usable unit of account and supports consistent communication across tools and interfaces.</p><h2 id="license" tabindex="-1">License <a class="header-anchor" href="#license" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;License&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All Moony brand assets are released under a <strong>Creative Commons CC0 license</strong>.
